# Playwright Automation Test Project

This project contains automation tests using Playwright with JavaScript/TypeScript for end-to-end web application testing.

## Install and Set Up Playwright

1. Initialize your npm project:

npm init -y

2. Install Playwright test framework:

npm install @playwright/test

3. Install necessary browser binaries:

npx playwright install

## Run the Test Suite

Run all tests in the default configuration:

npx playwright test

This command executes your test suite and generates reports and test results.

## Debug Tests

Run tests in debug mode with an interactive inspector and detailed logging:

npx playwright test --debug

This helps you pause execution, inspect elements, and step through your tests interactively.
